Note: This program uses the JavaFX library, make sure it is downloaded and linked to your IDE properly for the program to function. 

This is a JavaFX game, which is drawn to and played on a new window on the screen, that is a reworked and remastered version of my original Tic Tac Toe that ran on the console. 

I made this one to refine it and make it have actual graphics on a seperate window. 
- And also becasue I was bored.
